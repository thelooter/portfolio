**NOTE**

I'm not the original author of this App. I forked it when the repository seemed abandoned

Lab+ lets you see the latest happenings wherever you are, reply to issues so they can be taken care of faster, manage and organise projects with labels, browse your files, code and more!

_currently thinking about rewriting it in Kotlin with Compose Multiplatform_
